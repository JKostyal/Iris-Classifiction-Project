Classification problem to distinguish Iris flower species based on petal and sepal width and lengths. Simple, classic.

No data cleaning involved.

Focus on exploratory data analysis/data visualization and classification models K-NEarest Neighbors, RandomForest, 
Support Vector Machine,and Logistic Regression.

Found that Petal Widths and Lengths provided as much accuracy than using both Petal and Sepal data. Achieved 95.5% accuracy using SVM and KNN, k = 3.
